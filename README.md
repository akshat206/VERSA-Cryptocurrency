## Development of Own Crypto currency VERSA(VEC)

Deployed my own crypto coin by using smart contract on Ethereum and Soladity

Implementations of standards like ERC20 and ERC721.
Flexible role-based permissioning scheme.
Reusable Solidity components to build custom contracts and complex decentralized systems.

Used Metamask and deployed my network
